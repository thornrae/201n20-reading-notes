## RRD

1. What is the difference between a FIFO and standard queue - a FIFO queue is like a more strict standard queue.  A FIFO queue strictly preserves the order in which messages are added and also strictly allows a one time processing which helps to make sure that messages are not duplicated - which you may run into in a standard queue.

2. *How can the server be assured a message was properly received?* testing and/or use of status codes. 
3. *What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?* Observer Pattern: "software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods...mainly used in 'event driven' software" [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
[Software Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
4. *How do you test an event driven system?* Unit tests, service tests, end to end tests.
“Service tests for event driven systems operate on events for inputs and events for outs and are unaware of other services”. [Source](https://medium.com/dan-on-coding/testing-event-driven-systems-63c6b0c57517)


## DEFINE
Server: responds to client requests. This can be software or hardware. 

Pub/Sub: "messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes and only receives message that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are".

WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle -> Client makes a request to the server and the server provides a response.
