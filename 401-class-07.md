**Put in correct order:**
- register your app to get a client_id and client_secret
- ask client if they want to sign in via a 3rd party 
- redirect to 3rd party authentication endpoint
- make a request to a 3rd party API endpoint
- recieve authorization code 
- make request to access token endpoint
- receive access token

**What can you do with an authorization code?**
- with an authorization code you can split and decode to compare if user entered text exists in database
**What can you do with an access token?**
- with an access token a user is granted access to defined routes.
**What's a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?**

- sharing user data between applications without sharing the user's credentials. For ex: logging into spotify thru facebook or logging into codepen account using your github login credentials. "known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization".

**VOCAB**
*Client ID* username or some information unique to the user. 
*Client secret* is app level environment variable.  Adds a second layer of verification to the token created. 
*Authentication endpoint* the route in which authentication occurs.
*API Endpoint* "the means from which teh API can access the resources they need from a server to perform their task...the location where the API sends a request and where the response emenates is what is known as an edpoint...it is what the developer will implemente to make their requests"
https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/endpoint/ 
*Authorization code* sent thru headers and is then decoded and compared (is this right??)
*Access Token* username + secret = authentication token

project specific environment variables
