JavaScript UI Frameworks: 
- Vue
- Angular
- Ruby on Rails
- Svelte
- Bootstrap 

A framework determines the architecture of an app.  A library contributes, when called, within that architecture.  Express is a framework and jQuery is a library.

Rendering: displays application in browser. [source](https://www.newmediacampaigns.com/blog/javascript-templates-and-how-we-use-them-in-hifi#:~:text=What%20are%20Javascript%20templates%3F&text=Popularized%20by%20John%20Resig%2C%20Javascript,variables%20or%20run%20programming%20logic.)

Templates: "isolate UI interaction client-side with minimal http requests to the server".  Improve speed of rendering. 

State: how changing and updating data of a component is managed.  Lines of code within the render(), within an ES6 class, that are in curly braces and have a reference "this". State is a property of the class constructor.  This constructor takes in props and calls super.
