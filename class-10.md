### JS CH10: Debugging

Summary: 
- If you understand exeuction contacts (which was two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code
- Debugging is the process of finding errors.  It involves a process of deduction 
- The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try and find the exact error 
- JS has 7 different types of errors.  Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error (all are listed in the chapter)
- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.  Use them to give your users useful feedback.
