# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN AND REGULAR EXPRESSIONS 

## GRID 
1. Like flexbox, first step is to apply `display: grid` to the parent/containing element
2. Next, declare column and row sizes. 
  - percentages are a good value to use
    - grid-template-columns: 
    - grid-template-rows:
3. To access certain rows/columns once created using the property above use: 
  - grid-column: start column number / end column number
  - grid-row: start row number / end row number
  - grid-area: row start/column start/row end / column end
    - using span defines columns based on desired column width and can be used in above properties
  - the order property can be set to a positive or negative integer, this is a helpful property when using grid BECAUSE if grid items aren't explicitly placed with grid-area they are automatically placed according to their order in the source code.  Using the order property overrides this (similar to z-index)
