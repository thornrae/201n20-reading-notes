### Sending Form Data
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data

Think of an HTML form as a way to configure an HTTP request to send data to server. 

Attributes of the form element are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. 
  - Important attributes: 
    - action
        - defines where data gets sent, can be an absolute url or relative url
        - the NAME and VALUE attribute values are sent to the server as name=value&name=value
        - action value should be file on the server that can handle the incoming data
        - server responds, generally handling the data and loading the URL defined by the action attribute, which causes a new page to load
    - method
        - defines how data is sent (most common is GET and POST)
        - using GET, data sent to server from the form is appended to the URL
        - using POST, no data is appended to the URL

To view HTTP requets you need to look in the dev tools > network 

The way that data is retrieved is dependant upon the development platform being used and the frameworks being used with it. Examples are: 
  - PHP 
  - Python 
  - Django (framework for python)
  - Express (frameowkr for node js)
  - Laravel (framework for PHP)
  - Ruby on Rails (framework for Ruby)

Sending form data is easy but securing it can be tricky.
