# READ HTMLO5: IMAGES

Keep an image folder if building site from scratch with lots of images

To add images to a page use `<img>` tag along with 3 attributes: src, alt, title.  You can also format size of image using height and width attributes. This helps the webpage render the image better.

Where you place an image matters.  When img tag is placed inside a block element, content flows around the image. If block line element follows an img element, the block line starts on a new line

Align used to be an attribute but it is no longer used in HTML5

Save your image in the same size as it'll appear on the website. Measure in pixels, resizing resources on pg.113

You can use ctrl + click on an im age to see its dimensions which is helpful to do if you are swapping an image out.
