### HTML Ch.16: Images
By default images are inline elements - they flow within the surrounding text.

Change image to click using the display: block; property in CSS.  You can then horizontally center the image use margin: auto.

Background images: by default repeat to fill the entire box.  
You select the background image in CSS by setting the background-image property to url('imagelinkpath');

Repeating image properties & values:
- background-repeat: 
    * repeat (image repeated horizontally and vertically - the default)
    * repeat-x (image is repeated horizontally only)
    * repeat-y (image is repeated vertically only)
    * no-repeat (image is only shown once)

- background-attached property: 
    * fixed (background image stays in the same position on the page)
    * scroll (the background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page)

- background-position property. usually has a pair of values, the first represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical. if no second value added defaults to center. you can also use percentages.
