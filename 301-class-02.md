# Read: 02 - jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## PP. 293-301

*JQUERY* accomplishes the same things we were doing with DOM manipulation but with less code and is functional across many browser platforms.
- uses CSS style selectors to select elements in the DOM.
- pass these CSS style selectors thru the shorthand -> $(), 
  - this then creates a jquery OBJECT which then grants access to a bunch of methods that you can attach and uuse with the object using member operator - dot

**Example of Syntax**
`$('li.hot').addClass('complete');`
  - this adds a class with value complete to all li's with the class value of hot
  - use this same syntax to create event handler functions with jquery. This looks like: 
    - $('li').on('click', function() {
      $(this).remove();
    })

TO USE - add jquery library to your HTML in script tag in addition to your linked JS file

"Matched set" and jquery selection is the same thing
  - can select one element or multiple
  - when getting info of multiple selected elements, it will by default only retrieve info on the first of those multiple items selected, unless you use specific method to do so, like .each() instead of .html()
  - when you SET info, however, if multiple elements are selected all of those elements will update not just the first one
  - this eliminates the need to loop thru in order to touch or change more than one element
      - refer to this as "implicit iteration" - which is the ability to update all of the elements in the jquery selection
  - jquery selections do not create copies of the element, but rather stores references to those elements
  - caching a jquery object stores a reference to the object in a variable
  - if you see $(document) --> this references the whole page

*Retrieving Element Content* 
  - .html() - retreive only HTML inside first element and any descendants
  - .text() - retrieves text content only from selected element and descendants

*Updating Elements* 
  - .html()
  - .text()
  - .replaceWith()
  - .remove()

*Changing Content* 
  - when updating content of an element, you can use a string, variable or function
  - use double quotes for the attributes themselves but single quotes when you append new element that has the attributes

*Inserting Elements*
  1. Create new element in jquery object `$('<li>')` - this creates new element with no value. `$('<li class="new"> item </li>')` - this creates new item with attribute and value
  2. Use method to insert content into the page
    - **store new elements in a variable**
  
  Use: 
  - before()
  - after()
  - prepend()
  - append()

*Getting and setting attribute values*
  - attr()
  - removeAttr()
  - addClass()
  - removeClass()

*Getting and setting CSS properties*
  - .css() allows you to retrieve AND set CSS properties

*Getting CSS Values*
  - indicate property you want retrieved in parentheses
  - syntax: var backgroundcolor = $('li').css('background-color');

*Setting CSS Values*
  - syntax: $('li').css('background-color', '#272727');
  - property name, value

*each()* 
  - allows you to recreate the functionality of a loop on a selection of elements
  - can perform one or more statemnts on each item in the selection
  - it takes ONE parameter AKA the function doing the thing to the stuff
  - access current element using $(this)
  - example: 
    $function(){
      `$('li').each(function(){
        var ids = this.id;
        $(this).append`('<span class="order">' + ids + '</span>')`
      })
    }`

*Event Methods*
  - use .on() method
  - syntax: 
      $('li').on('click', function(){
        do this stuff on click
      });

*The Event Object*
  - jquery event object has properties and methods that tell you more aobut the event that took place
    1. give event object a parameter name
    2. use that name in the function to reference the event object
    3. access the properties and methods of object using dot notation
        $('li').on('click', function(e){
          var eventType = e.type;
        })
  - property type examples listed on pg. 328 but examples are: type, which, data, target
