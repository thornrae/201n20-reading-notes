### When is basic authorization used v. bearer authorization
Basic authorization is used to authenticate a user (grab authorization header, extract components, autheticate).  Bearer Authorization is validating that a user has the correct token to proceed in the route, bearer authorization we are authenticating the token.

### What does the JSON web token package do
Creates a token based off of a users hashed username from the database + the app SECRET.

### What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET
Storing the secret someplace secure, (.env files are good) and storing secrets with some level of encryption.

### Define:
<p> <b>Encryption</b> is turning something from plain text into a undecipherable code.</p>
<p> <b>Token</b> is something that is generated unique to a user that is used to verify whether or not that user has access to certain parts of the site</p>
<p> <b>Bearer</b> the header in which tokens are passed </p>
<p> <b>Secret</b> the unique identifier of the app that is used in conjunction with the username to create a token</p>
<p> <b>JSON Web Token</b> "defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.  This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed"</p>
