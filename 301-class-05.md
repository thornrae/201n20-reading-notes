# Heroku Deployment

Heroku is a website that we use to deploy websites due to limitations of GitHub.  Github works best for static apps with a limited number of pages.

To get Heroku to work, you need to create a new app thru the heroku website and then you are able to link to your Github repo.  Heroku comes with a built in activity log which is helpful as you are building out and testing.

When using Heroku to deploy your website the file structure in VSCode is a bit different in that files live in a "public" (which is potatoes) folder.  So your index.html needs to live in that folder and then that folder needs to be mapped accurately in your server.js file.  The server.js file is what requests and receives information from Heroku's server (I THINK!)
