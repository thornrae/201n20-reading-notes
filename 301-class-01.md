## Responsive Webdesign

Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every size screen.

Focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone.

Responsive and adaptive design are interchangable terms.

*Three Main Components of Responsive Web Design* 
1. Flexible Layouts
  - the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid 
  - built using percentages or em units rather than fixed values like pixels 
  - to ID the proportions of a flexible layout using relative values, use formula: target/context = result

2. Media Queries 
  - Allows you to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances
  - Do this using @media inside an existing stylesheet (other ways to do this, but this method is preferred)
  - Media queries may include a media type followed by one or more expressions
    - common media types: all, screen, print, tv, braille
  - Uses own type of logical operators (and, not and only)
  - MEDIA FEATURES identify why attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression.  
    - most commonly used features: min-width, max-height, orientation (portrait or landscape), aspect-ratio, device-aspect-ratio, resolution
  - Mobile first is a thing

3. Flexible Media 
  - Media types also need to be scalable.
  - Quick way to do this is use max-width property with a value of 100%, this ensures that as viewport gets smaller, media will scale down according to its containers width
    - **this does not work with embedded media**
  - To make embedded media scalable:
    - Emebed element needs to be absolutely positioned within its parent element 
    - parent el needs to have a width of 100% and height of 0 to trigger the layout mechanism within IE
    - give padding to botton of parent element a value which is set to same aspect ratio of embedded media.  If ratio is 16:9 do that formula --  9/16 = .5625, which as a percent is 56.25%

## ALL ABOUT FLOATS
https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/

Float is a CSS postion property.  Elements with this property remain a part of the flow of the web page (this is different from absolute positioning)

Float property values: left, right, both, none

Clear property is a float sister property. Values: both, left, right, none
  - this makes it so next element moves below previously floated element rather than putting it next to it

Collapsing happens to a parent el when all children are floated, this is weird, but it happens

How to fix collapsing? 
  - clear the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container

Techniques to fix collapsing:
  - use clear property - but this only works if you know the preceeding element
  - if you dont know preceeding element, make an empty div and apply clear property to that
  - or, use psuedo selector :after attached to a created class attribute on the element.  specific CSS included in this article
