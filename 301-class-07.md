#APIs CONTINUED: REST

HTTP is a protocol which is all about appplying verbs to nouns IE making components of your webpage or server DO things. 

The basic concept of web services or API is for machines to use the web like people do, IE computers using protocols to send messages back and forth to each other. 

We want all machines everywhere to be able to talk to all machines anywhere all the time. This is important because being able to do this facilitates "redirects" which is pretty much like it sounds.

REST stands for representational state transfer.  It is a software architectural style.  An example of RESTful frameworks is: Ruby on Rails

Methods that are used in a simple request are:
- GET() systems retrieving info from each other
- POST() one system adding something to another system
- PUT() replaces something in another system
- PATCH() partial update of a system by a different system

### SUPERAGENT 
https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#promise-and-generator-support 
*SUPERAGENT* is a light weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility and readibility
  - a request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object then calling.
  - use .then() .end() or await *this one is little different and doesnt seem to have the parentheses the way that a .then and .then does) to send the request

An example of a simple GET request looks like this

request 
  .get('/search')
  .then(res => {
    //res.body, res.headers, res.status
  })
  .cath(err => {
    //err.message, err.response
  })

Other methods that can be used in place of .get are: 
- delete
- head
- patch
- post 
- put 

.set allows setting header fields, invoke with a field name and value
