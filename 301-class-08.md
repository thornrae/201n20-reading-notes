# READ 08: SQL

Table in a database should be thought of as a two dimensional set of rows and columns, with columns being the properties and the rows being the instances of the entity of the table.

*Basic Syntax:* 
To retrieve data we need to use SELECT followed by column name (can do one or more separated by comma) FROM tablename;

SQL does not require capitalization of keywords but helpful for the eyes

To select all columns * 
SELECT * FROM tablename

*Queries with Constraints* 
SELECT column, another_column, ..
FROM mytable
WHERE condition 
AND/OR another condition ... etc. 

More complex causes can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords as well as...

- =, !=, <, <=, >, >= (standard numberical operators)
    - ex: col_name != 4
- BETWEEN ... AND .. (number is within a range of the two values)
  - ex: col_name BETWEEN 1.5 and 10.5
- NOT BETWEEN ... AND ... (number is not within a range of 2 values)
  - ex: col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 and 10
- IN (...) (number exists in a list)
  - ex: col_name IN (2,4,6)
- NOT IN (...) (number does not exist in a list)
  - ex: col_name NOT IN (1,3,5)
- = (case sensitive, exast string comp)
  - ex: col_name = "abc"
- != or <> (case sensitive exact string inequality comp)
  - ex: col_name != "abcd"
- LIKE & NOT LIKE (case INSENSITIVE exact string comp)
  - ex: col_name LIKE "ABCD"
- % (used anywhere in a stringto match a sequence of zero or more characters to be used with LIKE or NOT LIKE)
  - ex: col_name LIKE "%AT%" returns matches with AT .. CAT, BAT, SAT
- `-` (used anyway in a string to match a single character used with LIKE or NOT LIKE) 
  - ex: col_name LIKE "AN_" returns matches AND but not AN
- NOT/IN (...)   (string exists in/not in a list)
  - ex: col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")

*Filtering and Sorting Query Results*
Even tho data in a database may be unique the results of any a particular query may not be - for example more than one movie was released in the same year.  In such cases, SQL provides a way to discard rows that have a duplicate column calue by using the DISTINCT. This query blindly removes duplicate rows. So can manage using GROUP BY clause.

*ORDERING RESULTS*
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
Other clauses that can be used with ORDER BY - LIMIT (reduces the number of rows) and OFFSET (specifies where to begin counting rows from)

**Database Schema** describes the structure of each table and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain

*INSERTING ROWS/NEW DATA*
Syntax: you can add directly to table to create new columns with corresponding value data for example.. 

INSERT INTO boxoffice (movie_id, rating, sales_in_millions)
VALUES (1, 9.9, 283743/100000);

Need to have values for all column headers

*UPDATING EXISTING DATA*
Statement used: UPDATE
  - must specify what table, columnns and rows to update. Updated data must match the data type of the columns in the table schema

Ex: 
UPDATE mytable
SET column = valueorexpression, other_column=valueor expression
WHERE condition
^ this statement works by taking multiple column/value pairs and applying those changes to each and every row that satisfies the constraint in the WHERE clause

*DELETING ROWS*
Statement used: DELETE FROM mytable WHERE condition

Leaving out the WHERE condition removes all rows - which is an easy way to clear out a table completely IF that is what you are trying to do.

*CREATING TABLES*
Statement Used: CREATE TABLE IS NOT EXISTS mytable (column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value...)

Structure is defined by table schema which defines a series of columns, which each have a name, the type of data that is allowed in that column and OPTIONAL table constraint OPTIONAL default value.

EX:

CREATE TABLE movies (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  director TEXT,
  year INTEGER,
  length_minutes INTEGET
);

*ALTERING TABLES*
ALTER TABLE allows you to add, remove or modigy columns and table constraints.

ADD column
DROP column
RENAME TO newtablename

*DROPPING TABLES*
Use DROP TABLE statement.  This is different from DELETE statement in that it also removes table schema from the database entirely

Add IF EXISTS clause to avoid errors if that table doesn't exist
