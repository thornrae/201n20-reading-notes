# Database Normalization

Tables should have one purpose.
The goal of database normalization is to avoid modification anomolies aka when many things get changed in error due to a certain modification of the database. 

Three main reasons to normalize a database: 
  1. minimize duplicate data
  2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
  3. simplify queries

Three Modification Anomolies
  1. Insert anomaly
  2. Update anomaly  
  3. Deletion anomaly

Database Normalization Forms
1NF, 2NF and 3NF (1st 2nd and 3rd normal form) - these are progressive forms starting with 1NF. To get to 3NF you must pass the first two.
  - First Normal Form: info is stored in relational table with each column containing atomic values.  There are no repeating groups of columns. 
  - Second Normal Form: the table is in first normal form and all teh columns depend on the table's primary key 
  - Third normal form: table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key

There are also other forms such as BCNF - but these are more advanced.
