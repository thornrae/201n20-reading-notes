Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's v8 JavaScript engine

Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is an open source Javascript engine that runs in Chrome and Chrome based browsers

JavaScript runtime means a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. 

npm is a JavaScript package manager.  Has a million (?) packages that you can install either globally or locally on your machine

The bigguest use cases for Node.js is that it lets us run JavaScript on the server.

Node is a single threaded and event-driven, meaning that everything that happens in node is in reaction to an event.

Node is sutied to apps that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration.  It is also good for building APIs.  

You can use frameworks to reduce boilerplate.  Express is a front running example here and while it is minimal there are other (Rails or Laravel for example) that come with a lot of functionality out the gate.

Advantages of using Node.js: 
- Speed and scalability 
- For developers, allows you to do everything in the same language.  For example, sharing code between server and client
- Speaks json (important!)
