**3 real world cases where you'd want to change the request with custom  middleware**
1. Login authentication
2. Logging data to get user insights
3. Error handling

**True or false: the route handler is middleware**
False.  A route handler can make requests and get responses without middleware.  Middleware can be added to route handlers or other functions to alter/shape requests/responses.

**In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the  browser?**
Thru the use of the next().  Or, 500 errors.  If an error is triggered, it will end the WRRC and send the 500 message to the user thru the broswer.

**At what point in the request lifecycle can you "inject" middleware**
Middleware can be injected to shape the way the request object.

**What can cause express to error with "Request headers send twice, cannot start a second response**
This happens when you have more than one response being sent to your client. This happened to me when I had, erroneously, included a response statement in my validator function AND my app.get route.

**DEFINE**
*Middleware* is code that can accompanies a request so as to modify the request object. 
*Request Object* is the data retrieved from the server.
*Response Object* is the data that is sent to the browser.
*Application Middleware* is associated with "app.use()" and is applied to the entire application.
*Test Driven Development* is development that is built created based upon its ability to pass a unit test.
*Behavioral Testing* is a way of describing the app in testing units or bench marks that can be communicated between an engineering team and other stakeholders, like a UX design team and is constructed more or less in sentences.

**Better clarity?**
- Super class calls (I think)
- Routes

**Hoping to learn more**
- what would be the use cases of using a named v. unnamed class?
 
**Excited to try**
- express.Router
