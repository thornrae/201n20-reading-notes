REVIEW, RESEARCH & DISCUSSION
- Access control is important for site management, in that it gives certain users certain access to certain areas of the site.  
- The word press hosted website that my organzation uses is an example of a web application that benefits from access control.  Only one person is able to make an post edits to pages, as the admin, and other people are only able to view content or edit but not update. 
- A role is used to determine what a user has access and the ability to do within the site. 
- Role based access "makes it simple for owners to manage users in groups based on their role or position, rather than assigning permissions to each specific individual. RBAC largely eliminates discretion when providing access to objects" [source](https://umbrellatech.co/access-control/system-types/)
