**Singleton in computer science terms** refers to a single instance of something.  
**How singleton pattern can be used with node modules, specifically with classes** a singleton pattern can (and should?) be used with node modules so that you only have one area or location in your software that is making the node.  This is achieved using class syntax. 
**If tasked with building a middleware system like express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?** Express is an app level middleware system that needs to be used throughout the entire app in order for the app to run as an express app.
