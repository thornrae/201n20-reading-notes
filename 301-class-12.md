# EJS Partials

https://medium.com/@henslejoseph/ejs-partials-f6f102cb7433

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
  - Think of partials as functions, making maintenance of large websites easier to maintain because you don't have to change a piece of text in every page it appears in. 
  - Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.
  - Good candidates for partials - text/info that appear in multiple places
  - These files get their own EJS file in views/partials directory
      - for example navbar.ejs or footer.ejs
      - these files hold only code for that information
    - then, you use these files in your home.ejs and other different page files that include what you are targeting

Linking the partial file to the appropriate ejs file: 
  - <%-include('partials/navbar') %>
