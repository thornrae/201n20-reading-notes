# CALLSTACK & DEBUGGING

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack
### MDN
A *call stack* is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JS interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions -- what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function
    - When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function
    - any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run when their calls are reached
    - when the current function is finished, the interpeter takes it off the stack and resumes execution it left off in the last code listing
    - if the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error

Essentially, you start with an empty Call Stack and whenever a function is invoked, it is automatically added to the Call Stack.  Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack and the stack is empty again.

### What the JS Call Stack Is and Why It Is Necessary 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/

- Call stack is used for function invocation
- Function execution is done one at a time, from top to bottom - this means that the call stack is synchronous
- Think of call stack as a data structure that uses Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation
    - ie: the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to leave the stack when the function returns
- When a function is invoked, the function, its parameters and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame.  The stack from is memory location in the stack, temporarily stored, and cleared when the function returns as it is poopped of out of the stack
- The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame(aka manages function invocation), it knows the next function to be executed and it will remove it after execution
    - this is what makes code execution in javascript synchronous
- Stack Overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.  A hosting environment (browser) has a max stack call that it can accomodate BEFORE throwing a stack error.
    - This will cause stack overflow: 
            function callMyself(){
              callMyself();
            }
            callMyself();
*SUMMARY OF THE CALLSTACK*
- It is single threaded meaning it can only do one thing at a time
- Code execution is synchronus
- A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory
- It works as a LIFO structure

## JavaScript Error Message & Degbugging
https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c

**Types of Errors**
- Reference Errors: occur when variable is used but not yet declared can be fixed by declaring the variable before any declaration is made

- Syntax Errors: occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed because of syntax

- Range Errors: happens when you try to manipulate an object with some kind of length but give it an invalid length.  Can be avoided by not mutating your variables whenever possible

- Type Errors: Occurs when the types of data you are trying to access or use are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.  To fix just make sure that the value you are trying to access exists before you try to access it

**Debugging**
To check for bugs,the easiest way is to use your console.log() to check what is going on.  You can also put a debugger statement in your code in the line that you want to break or add conditional breakpoints by right clicking a previous break point set.

You can also use node.js with vscode and press the debug tab and add a configuration similar to what is listed in this article. Run the beugger by pressing F5 or pressing the green play button

Call Stacks in debugging or errors will show up as red and represent the path that your program has taken to reach the point where you set a breaking point or where you have an error. 

IIFE = immediately invoked function expression

**Handling Errors**
It is good to attempt to use TRY and CATCH to catch errors so we can fallback to a default state of application. Using Try...Catch is beneficial because it will allow your application to keep running - perhaps with some side effects - but it wont break completely

Remember to remove debugging before a commit/push
