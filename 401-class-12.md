# Socket.io

## RRD

- The benefit of transforming data into packets is to be able to transfer them individually to reach their destination.  Upon reaching their destination, the destination recompiles the data passed thru the packet to adhere to the protocols of whichever TCP/UDP level they are at in the process. [Source](https://www.elprocus.com/what-is-a-packet-switching-modes-and-delays/)

- UDP is often refered to as a connectionless protocol because as a connectionless protocol it does not require the two endpoints (sending and recieving) to have an established connection.  I think that this is what allows the emit of listeners without needing a server set up? [Source](https://www.radware.com/glossary/connectionlessprotocol/)

- Can socket server application have multiple socket connections? Yes!

- Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? Maybe!

- Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection? No, they would need to be in different files. Also can someone tell me if these answers are correct?

## VOCAB
- Observer pattern "is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing." [Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer).  This is what allows us to emit into a "hub" and have whichever applications that are connected to that "hub" be able to listen for what is emitted and then act accordingly. 

- Listener: waits for a predefined (or just created/emitted) event to occur before running code. 

- Event Handler: is the function that is run which is dependent upon the event listener having happened

- Event Driving Programming: is our CAPS lab and essentially what we are focusing on now.  In event driven programming there are no function calls, rather, functions are ran based on the presence of an event happening.  It is the event (listener) that invoked the handler (function).

- Event Loop: the event loop is the flow of an even driven programming app.  Where one event triggers a handler which could emit an additional event or prompt change to the payload of an already existing event. 

- Event Queue: "an event queue is a repo where events from an application are held prior to being procesed by a receiving program or system" [Source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24963/event-queue)

- Call stack: "a mechanism for an interpreter (like JavaScript in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions" [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)

- Emit/Raise/Trigger: these words are synonymous and refer to when an event is being created using the emit() method

- Subscribe: establishing a connection between a server and an application.  This allows the application to receive information from the server and vice versa and happens after the "three-way handshake". Syn/Ack also are involved here, I believe. 

- database: a structured way to store data locally so as to not make repetive requests/receive repetitive responses.
