**Name 3 advantages to test driven development**
Anticipating bugs, refactoring code (easier to identify where bugs are), tests serve as documentation.

**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite**
When you have to do something repeatedly for many tests for example, initialize a function.

**What is the downside of test driven development**
Maintaining tests.  Can be seen as "slowing down" development, though, I would think the long range benefits would outweigh the short term. 

**What's the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes**
ES6 classes is like a container that holds the constructor and the methods associated with your instantiated object.  

**Why REST**
The WRRC is inherently stateless. Using REST creates states -  which is like creating knowledge of actions that happened before the client made the request and what will or should happen after the response is sent back to the client.  REST is used when you are talking to your API (vs. CRUD which is used when you are talking to a database)

**Define**

*Functional Programming* is based more on calculations and returning a mathemetical value. "What to solve" versus "how to solve". This is also supported in Javascript. 

*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* can be used to describe Javascript.  Objects are a data structure that hold properties that liken to "real world objects" which have properties and methods.

*class* is like a constructor on steroids.  In addition to instantiating an object based on properties included in the constructor within the class, this syntax also allows for methods to be connected to instantiated objects.

*super* allows you to invoke functions from the parent object. This makes medium sense with calling static methods, but less sense when using while extending classes.

*this* the contextual this is in reference to an instantiated object.

*TDD* test driven development is a way of developing code to pass tests first. In TDD before any implementation code is written at all, a test is created and then code is written to pass that test and THEN it is developed and refactored.

*Continuous Integration* helps to integrate changes into main code base.  It is a workflow strategy that helps ensure that everyone's local changes integrate and merge conflicts are reduced.  The server builds and tests the code to determine if it works and if it can be merged with the main branch.

*REST* representational state transfer.

*Data Model* represents parts of data and defines that way that data interacts with each other and with the structure they are placed in.

**Got Clarity**
-SQL v. noSQL databases
**Want to Learn More**
- super and extends
- more testing methods that come with jest 
**Most Excited to Try**
working with a database with meaningful data
