# Read 03: MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX

## Flexbox Layout
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ 
This is an efficient way to layout, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unnkown and/or dynamic

- The main idea is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill available space
- A flex container expains items to fill available free space OR shrinks them to prevent overflow
- Flexbox layout is direction-agnostic.  This is different from regular layouts where block elements are vertical and in line elements are horizontal
- Still, a grid layout works best for larger scale layouts

Making it happen
- Need to put `display: flex` in the parent container then can you any of following properties on container elements to get desired layout
  - flex-direction 
  - flex-wrap
  - flex-flow (shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap in one property)
  - justify-content
  - align-items
  - align-content (similar to how justify-content handles individual items)

Properties to use on flex items (AKA children of flex container)
  - order (default is at 0)
  - flex-grow
  - flex-basis
  - flex
  - align-self
