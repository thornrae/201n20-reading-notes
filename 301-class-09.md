# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa

Functional programming avoids changing-state and mutable data

**Pure Functions** 
  - return the same result if given the same arguments (also refered to as deterministic)
      - functions written in a way that passes or refers to a global variable rather than passing that variable thru the function as a parameter is an impure function
      - a global variable has the potential to change or be updated.  If a function only takes in one parameter but the the code then references a global variable, then that means that you can pass the same argument into a function and get different results which is the OPPOSITE of what a pure function is
      - if a function reads an external file it is not a pure function because the file's contents can change
      - any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure, same thing. 
  - It does not cause observable side effects
      - AKA it does not modify a global object or a parameter passed by reference - mutability is discouraged
          - rather than changing a global variable, return the value of the code block
          - **THIS**
            let counter = 1;

            function increaseCounter(value) {
            counter = value + 1;
            }
            increaseCounter(counter);
            console.log(counter); // 2

            **BECOMES**

            let counter = 1;

            const increaseCounter = (value) => value + 1;

            increaseCounter(counter); // 2
            console.log(counter); // 1    

*BENEFITS*
- Code is easier to test, allowing you to unit test pure functions with different contexts.

**IMMUTABILITY** 
When data is immutable its state cannot change after its created. Because you can't cahnge an immutable object, you create a new object with a new value (like how map() returns a new mutated array)

To handle mutability in iteration, we use Recursion.
  -Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. 
    - Generally solved by iteration
    - Uses functions to call themselves from within their own code
        let list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        let accumulator = 0;

        function sum(list, accumulator) {
        if (list.length == 0) {
        return accumulator;
        }

        return sum(list.slice(1), accumulator + list[0]);
        }
    - to avoid mutating the input state, the result of a function will be used as an input for the next function, without modifying the original input string

The idea of functions as first-class entities is that in these cases, functions are treated as values and used as data and can 
  - refer to it from constants and variables
  - pass it as a paramter to other functions 
  - return it as results from other functions

Treat fuctions as values and pass functions like data.  This allows combination of different functions to create new functions with new behavior

**HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS** 
  - takes one of more functions as arguments 
  - returns a function as its result
      - filter: 
        - if callback function is true, filter function will include the element in the result collection, otherwise doesn't
        - rather than pushing new values to an empty array (imperative approach) you add a return to the line of code doing the executing (declarative approach).  
      - map
        - the idea is to transform a collection.
        - applies a function all of its elements and builds a new collection from the returned values
      - reduce
        - the idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining items

**COMPOSING FUNCTIONS**
Get total amount of all books in our shopping cart: 
    1. filter by book type
    2. transform shopping card into collection of amount using map
    3. combine all items by adding them up with reduce
<!-- -----
  let shoppingCart = [
  { productTitle: "Functional Programming", type: "books", amount: 10 },
  { productTitle: "Kindle", type: "eletronics", amount: 30 },
  { productTitle: "Shoes", type: "fashion", amount: 20 },
  { productTitle: "Clean Code", type: "books", amount: 60 }
]

const byBooks = (order) => order.type == "books";
const getAmount = (order) => order.amount;
const sumAmount = (acc, amount) => acc + amount;

function getTotalAmount(shoppingCart) {
  return shoppingCart
    .filter(byBooks)
    .map(getAmount)
    .reduce(sumAmount, 0);
}

getTotalAmount(shoppingCart); // 70

## REFACTORING JAVASCRIPT FOR READBILITY

**TIPS**
  - return early from functions
  - cache variables so functions can be read like sentences 
  - check for WEB APIs before implementing your own functionality
