Linked lists are a type of data structure.  They are most similar to arrays in that they represent a chunk, or list, or data.  But, there are some marked differences.

LINKED LIST V. ARRAY
- Structure: linked lists are constructed out of nodes. These nodes contain data and reference to the next node (if it exists).  This "reference to next" is the glue that holds linked lists together. It is an object, inside of an object, inside of the object etc. 
- Memory: an array requires reference to it's data to be sequential and in order.  A linked list, however, does not require the reference to it's data to be stored in memory that is next to each other.  This makes linked lists more efficient than arrays in certain cases.
- Traversing: You can use multiple types of loops with arrays, but with linked lists you can really only use a while loop.
    - in order to traverse a linked list, always start at the head.
    - if the head's .next is null, then you have nothing to traverse. But, if the head's .next has a value, then you have traversable nodes.
    - in order to traverse (using a while loop), you need to set your head to current and then before the while loop restarts, you need to update your current variable to current.next --> this pops you into the next node.
    - you can replace your head node, insert within the linked list or insert at the end of the linked list, you just need to be careful in managing where you .next is pointed.  And, if you are inserting making sure that previous node's next now points to new inserted node.
    - you always need to start at the head.
